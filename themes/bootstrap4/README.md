This is a theme based on Bootstrap 4. Just like Bootstrap 4 itself, this theme is in alpha state.

Should work:

* posts and pages (duh!)
* navbar
* pagination
* tag page

With issues:

* listings (icons replaced by emoji â€” Bootstrap 4 provides none, and we are not forcing an icon theme yet)
* galleries (errors in console, requires non-slim jQuery, icons replaced by emoji)

Broken:

* slides
